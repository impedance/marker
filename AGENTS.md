# Repository Guidelines

This project converts DOCX or documents into chaptered Markdown files with accompanying assets as described in `architecture.md`.

## Development Principles
- Follow SOLID, KISS, DRY, and general clean code practices.
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all features.

## Workflow
1. Write failing tests that describe new functionality.
2. Implement code to make tests pass.
3. Keep code small and focused; avoid redundancy.
4. Run `pytest` before committing.
5. Ensure commits keep the repository in a clean state.
